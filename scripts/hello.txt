Born into the royal family, precocious cub Simba spends his days exploring the sprawling savanna grasslands and idolizing his kingly father, Mufasa, while youthfully shirking the responsibility his position in life requires. When an unthinkable tragedy, orchestrated by Simba’s wicked uncle, Scar, takes his father’s life, Simba flees the Pride Lands, leaving his loss and the life he knew behind. Eventually companioned by two hilarious and unlikely friends, Simba starts anew. But when weight of responsibility and a desperate plea from the now ravaged Pride Lands come to find the adult prince, Simba must take on a formidable enemy, and fulfill his destiny to be king.

Influenced by Bradbury’s background in dance—and lush with gauzy appropriated images and the intricate elegance of embroidery and floral patterns—modes of creativity converge in her work to invoke an illusion of subdued stillness that obscures the shockwaves of passion that secretly exist, hidden and restless, just below the surface.  Bradbury invites the viewer to question how perspectives change: How do we, in a single encounter, experience that which is presented explicitly and that which is obscured? What hidden beauty does one see that another might miss?  How do we decide what to conceal and what to confess, and when and how to reveal that which is hidden? Learn more about the exhibit.
